This is a Work-in-progress tech demo for my upcoming project, Marquee.

Marquee is a platform that allows teachers or other educators to quickly and easily create interactive flashcard experiences, and pair them with fun quizzes.

This tech demo aims to be a representation of what the flashcard pack creation interface will look like, and is no way a functional app.
If you have any ideas or suggestions for this part of the app, please submit a pull request with your changes.

Stay tuned for further updates and tech demos!
