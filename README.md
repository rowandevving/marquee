This is the landing page (not the actual app) of a Work-in-progress project, Marquee. Check out the main app ![here](https://github.com/rowandevving/marquee-app).

Marquee is a platform that allows teachers or other educators to quickly and easily create interactive flashcard experiences, and pair them with fun quizzes.

It is in its very early stages and is no way a functional app, and I will most likely be the sole contributor to this project until it expands significantly.

Stay tuned for further updates!
